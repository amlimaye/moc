# moc
A small personal project showing how the Boltzmann distribution arises in a simple combinatorics problem (hence the name, `moc` = multi-oscillator combinatorics).

Samples assignments of K balls in N bins and computes the empirical distribution over the number of balls in the first bin. Employs importance sampling to overcome difficulties with a naive sampling technique.
